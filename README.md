## 🏛️ Repository Organization (canon law)

This repository holds the **Ash & Archive ecosystem** — kept deliberately separated from its products:

```
/                          ← Ash & Archive: The Studio (the ecosystem's web presence — this app)
├── canon/                 ← ECOSYSTEM LAW: the constitution every A&A product inherits
│   └── ASH-AND-ARCHIVE-CANON.md
└── products/              ← each product's own complete canon + build
    └── the-codex/         ← THE CODEX: the first flagship Wing (built inside A&A, not the same thing as A&A)
        └── GENESIS/       ← ✅ v2.0 — COMPLETE canonical design specification, READY TO BUILD
                             12 chapters + council record: philosophy, mental model, Ledger System
                             design language, the Table/Desk/Ledger stances, AI constitution,
                             technical architecture, gated roadmap, and the AAA council pass.
                             Build entry point: GENESIS/10-ROADMAP.md (Phase 0.5 spikes first).
```

**Status (2026-07-06): The Codex GENESIS specification is bound at v2.0 and marked build-ready.** It survived a five-seat adversarial design-council pass (~120 findings integrated — see `products/the-codex/GENESIS/11-AAA-ENHANCEMENT.md`). A&A and The Codex remain separate by law: the ecosystem canon lives in `canon/`; The Codex inherits it and never redefines it.
