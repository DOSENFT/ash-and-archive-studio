## BR-001 · `@ash-archive/ledger-tokens` — the Ledger System token contract (2026-07-19)

**What shipped.** `packages/ledger-tokens` — GENESIS 03 §XI made real: the three-layer
token architecture (primitive → semantic → component) as one typed, canon-cited source
(`src/tokens.ts`) deterministically emitting `tokens.css` + `tokens.json` (both
committed; CI asserts byte-identity with emission, so source/artifact drift cannot be
committed silently). Contract id `ledger-tokens-v1`.

**Verified.** Strict tsc clean · **60/60 tests green**, including the §II v2
contrast matrix as a *computed* Phase 0 CI assertion (WCAG 2.2 math implemented in
`src/color.ts`; OKLCH→sRGB for the severity ramp; gamut checks on every emitted
oklch token) · structural invariants (exactly four registers, three easings, three
faces, 8/16/32 spacing; every emitted `ms` value inside the register law).

**Non-dictated decisions, recorded (none silent):**
1. **Severity stop interpolation is linear** between the sealed endpoints
   (§II v2 gives endpoints + count only).
2. **`--severity-text-N` derived register** (hue/chroma preserved, L 0.68): §II v2
   commands rubricated text ≥4.5:1, which sealed stops 2–5 cannot satisfy on any page
   ground. Named choice: *the text carries the hue; the depth lives in the cast.*
3. **The contrast-license registry**: canon's "or is registered decorative-only"
   mechanism made explicit as data. Notable registrations from computation:
   `gold-dim` = large/glyph only (≈3.97:1 on canvas) · `heal` = text on canvas/surface,
   large on raised (4.44:1) · `wound` = large only on canvas/surface, decorative on
   raised (2.87:1) · **`arcane` = decorative everywhere** (≈2.56:1 on canvas — it is
   the Academy's *thread*, never body text) · `ink.muted` = text on canvas only.
4. **Reduced-motion emitted as law**, not left to consumers: the `@media` block in
   `tokens.css` collapses state/transition/ceremony to 120ms, provides the 200ms turn
   crossfade, and stills the candle.
5. **Custom-property naming** follows canon's own names where canon names them
   (`--canvas`, `--ink-body`, `--gold-bright`, `--ease-considered`); minted names
   (`--dur-micro` etc.) recorded here.
6. **Font files deferred** to the first embodied surface — §IV requires self-hosted
   woff2; shipping an `@font-face` that points at nothing would be a placeholder
   pattern, which the charter forbids. Stacks are the contract meanwhile.

**⚑ Errata for the canon holder (canon untouched, CI-pinned):**
- **E-1 · `ink.muted` on `canvas` measures ≈4.4963:1** — just under the ≥4.5:1 that
  GENESIS 03 §II v2's "contrast-repaired" note certifies. The independent-recomputation
  discipline exists precisely for this. Options: (a) erratum lifting muted one step
  (e.g. #8b8176 passes at body scale) — Ledger-System-invisible to the eye; (b) register
  muted large/decorative on canvas and let footnotes use `ink.secondary`. CI pins the
  measured value until ruled.
- **E-2 · `ink.body` on `canvas` measures ≈5.45:1**, not the 4.6:1 §X documents.
  Passing either way; recorded so 4.6 is never re-cited as the margin.

**Next slice candidates (in dependency order):** EMB-2 self-hosted fonts + the first
token consumer (retire the root app's Google-Fonts CDN + off-canon Tailwind palette,
which predate canon and violate §I/§II) · EMB-3 `ledger-lint` (token-only rendering,
CI teeth) · EMB-4 the folio chrome primitives (vertical runner, roman pagination,
margin architecture) against sealed SPEC-002 shapes — the seated composer instrument
itself still gates on the CB1 seal (SHIP-LEDGER row 7).

## BR-002 · Fonts made real + the shell becomes the first token consumer (2026-07-19)

**What shipped.** (a) GENESIS 03 §IV's faces now physically exist in the product:
self-hosted woff2 under `packages/ledger-tokens/fonts/` (Crimson Pro variable
200–900 + italic · IBM Plex Sans variable + italic · IBM Plex Mono 400/500), OFL
licenses alongside, exported as `@ash-archive/ledger-tokens/fonts.css`. Until this
slice the shell *declared* the faces but loaded nothing — the desk was actually
rendering Georgia. (b) `apps/studio-shell` is the first consumer: every color, face,
size, tracking, and duration in `style.css` is now a token or a `color-mix()`
derivation of one — zero raw values. Off-canon values purged and grep-verified gone
from the built bundle: the desk's gold was `#c9a227` (sealed gold is `#c9a862`),
its page `#1d1b17`, its inks `#c9c2b4`/`#8a8375`, the journey's `#e8e2d4`/`#a89f8d`.

**Verified.** Shell strict tsc clean · vite build green, all 12 woff2 bundled ·
built-CSS grep: six off-canon hexes absent, canon values present. The founder's
walk-through (Wonder/Purist pattern) remains the experiential gate.

**Non-dictated decisions, recorded (none silent):**
1. **The manuscript reads at `--type-section` (18px)** — the desk sits closer to the
   eye than the table; the scale is sizes, not roles. Leading corrected to the sealed
   1.55 (was an off-law 1.75). The words are `--ink-body` — running text, never white.
2. **The desk-foot rule is `--ink-ghost`** — §II v2 assigns rules to ghost by law;
   the old value was a ground hex moonlighting as a border.
3. **Footer/chip labels sit at the footnote register (11px)** with the lawful 0.12em
   tracking (were 9–10px at 0.08/0.1em — off-scale, off-law).
4. **`font-display: block`** — a local instrument loads instantly; words arrive
   inked, never swapping over a fallback ghost.
5. **Subsets latin + latin-ext** — worldbuilding is full of diacritics.
6. **IBM Plex Mono ships static 400/500** — no official variable release exists;
   §IV's "variable" hosting ideal is met where upstream publishes one.
7. **The desk-sheet shadow stays** — it is the lantern grounding the sheet in the
   scene (the desk composes INTO a world still), not SaaS elevation. The 2px radii
   stay pending the CB1 seal (its no-radii lint is unsealed law).
8. **The journey engine's `--sw-*` seams now feed from tokens** (obsidian, gold,
   primary/secondary ink) — the vendored engine stays verbatim (sealed working
   state); only its declared theming surface is fed canon.
9. **Root-app retirement deferred to its own slice** — the pre-canon React
   landing/dashboard violates §I/§II wholesale (glassmorphism, cyan/purple, CDN
   fonts); it deserves a deliberate embodiment, not a palette swap.

**⚑ For the canon holder:** none new. (E-1/E-2 stand from BR-001.)

---

## BR-003 · `ledger-lint` — token-only rendering with CI teeth (2026-07-19)

**What shipped.** `packages/ledger-tokens/scripts/ledger-lint.mjs` — GENESIS 03 §XI's
"Wings consume tokens, never raw values" enforced structurally on consumer surfaces.
Six rules, all derived from sealed law only: L1 raw hex · L2 raw color functions and
color-mix() with any non-token color argument · L3 raw cubic-bezier · L4 font-family
not via `var(--font-…)` · L5 numeric durations on transition/animation · L6 hex color
strings in TS/JS. Allowances exist but are loud: `ledger-lint: allow(<rule>) <reason>`
with a mandatory reason, visible in every diff. Exempt: `vendor/` (sealed working
state, themed only through its declared `--sw-*` seams), `.d.ts`, and the token
package itself. Wired into the shell's `build` script — a violating build cannot ship.

**The lint's first catch, immediately:** `main.ts` was still feeding the vendored
engine the off-canon gold `#c9a227` from TypeScript — EMB-2's CSS purge had missed
the code path. Now a typed import: `gold.base` from the token package. The desk
shadow's raw `rgba(10,9,7,…)` literals became var-only `color-mix()` over obsidian.

**Verified.** Positive: shell `src` lints clean. Negative: a bait file carrying a raw
hex, an off-register 300ms transition, a fourth font, and a literal-color color-mix
trips all four expected rules and exits 1. Full chain green after the fixes:
lint clean → strict tsc clean → vite build green → ledger-tokens 60/60.

**Non-dictated decisions, recorded (none silent):**
1. **Only sealed-derivable rules.** CB1's stricter bench-lint set (no box-shadows,
   no border-radii, licensed opacities) is UNSEALED — those rules arrive with the
   CB1 seal, not before. The lint's rule list cites its law per rule.
2. **Spacing is not linted** (yet): a mechanical px-literal rule cannot distinguish
   layout dimensions from the 8/16/32 spacing law without CSS-property context;
   spacing stays a review concern until a property-aware rule is worth its
   complexity.
3. **TS rule is colors-only** — millisecond literals in code are behavior timing
   (save debounce, deadlines), which is core/spec jurisdiction, not presentation.
4. **The bug found by verification, recorded honestly:** the first color-mix parser
   broke on `var(--…)`'s own close-paren and flagged ten lawful lines; rewritten to
   match the lawful form whole. The negative bait check now guards the lint itself.

## BR-004 · The Desk embodied — the first embodied surface (2026-07-19)

**What shipped.** The product's one real seated surface — the Codex desk from the
founder's /GOAL build — now carries the sealed signature patterns. Behavior is
byte-equivalent (save, load, 500ms debounce, walk-again, announcements untouched);
only the physical form changed:

1. **The vertical runner** (GENESIS 03 §IV.4) — *the* Codex, rotated up the sheet's
   left margin in the §IV.1 pattern (italic "the" + small-caps, Crimson Pro at the
   caption register). The book tells you what page you're on without a header bar —
   and per §X it is now literally the region's accessible label
   (`role="region" aria-labelledby`).
2. **The scribe's-hand arrival** (§XI-a — "no spinners, ever") — faint ruled lines
   (ink-ghost, spaced at exactly the manuscript's line rhythm:
   `--type-section × --leading-body`) sketch the page's structure; the runner, the
   manuscript, and the footer settle in top-to-bottom at the lawful 40ms Desk
   stagger, each over the State register with reveal-ease; the rules dismiss as the
   ink arrives. Under `prefers-reduced-motion`: instant, rules never drawn.
3. **The caret is the actionable metal** — `caret-color: var(--gold)`; a held
   selection is gilded the same way (gold at 25% over the page). Named choice: the
   caret is where you can act, *now* — the Gold Law applied to the writing point.
4. **Keyboard focus made lawful** — `:focus-visible` on the walk-again affordance
   is a hairline gold outline, not the UA default.

**Verified.** ledger-lint clean (it caught its author once mid-slice — a stray `0ms`
literal — and the line was deleted, not allowed) · strict tsc clean · vite build
green · HTTP verification against the served build: page + CSS live, runner /
scribe-hand / gold-caret rules present in the shipped bundle, Crimson Pro woff2
HTTP 200, MANIFEST.json HTTP 200 (the desk's world-still backdrop resolves).
Chrome-extension screenshotting was unavailable in this remote session; the
founder's walk-through (Wonder/Purist) remains the experiential gate, as chartered.

**Non-dictated decisions, recorded (none silent):**
1. **The /GOAL build's minimalism honored in degree** — only sealed §IV/§XI-a
   patterns were added; no index, no roman pagination (one page is "I OF I" —
   preciousness), no unrequested chrome. The founder's placeholder copy ("Write.")
   kept verbatim.
2. **Runner label ink is `--ink-muted` on canvas** — the licensed text pairing
   (E-1's borderline pair; if the canon holder rules E-1 toward re-registration,
   the runner moves to `--ink-secondary` in the same instrument).
3. **Wet ink (§III v2) deferred by architecture** — a textarea cannot style
   character ranges; the sheen-that-mattes arrives with the contenteditable folio
   architecture (EMB-5+), not as a fake overlay.
4. **The arrival is loading choreography (§XI-a), not page motion under the
   airlock** — it runs strictly after journey teardown, inside the seated page's
   own jurisdiction, entirely within the State register.

## BR-005 · `@ash-archive/composer` — the sealed engine, built (2026-07-19)

**What shipped.** `packages/composer` — SPEC-002 v1.1 implemented mechanically from
the sealed document: the closed Element union + typed MarginSlot/Ribbon (§2), the
pure eight-stage `compose()` pipeline (§3.4), the deterministic fitter (§5.2, clock
partition included), both sealed Table profiles (§6.1/§6.2, M3 world-folio clock
uncap), the full ranking model (§7.2 hand priority + §7.5 zone orders, every
tie-break terminating in ULID), the §8.2 disposition table verbatim (ambiguous
events never auto, C-6), sync reaction ribbons (§9.2), pencil-only `enrich()` with
the C-5 structural guard (§10), the precise `inputHash` (§11.2 H4), and the thin
`ComposerRuntime` (§4 — wiring only; prevHandOrder in-memory per ADR-002-B).

**Verified.** Strict tsc clean (`exactOptionalPropertyTypes`, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`) ·
**37/37 tests green** against a REAL core vault (the shipping substrate, not mocks):
the mandatory 375×667 eight-condition Vitals fixture (one badge, pinned zone
unmoved, severity-5 rubric) · C-1 byte-identical determinism + JSON round-trip ·
C-3 12-card overflow → one MoreAffordance, nothing dropped · C-4 pinned immovable ·
C-5 enrich caps pencil at 2, body untouched, offline → folio unchanged · the §8.2
truth table + ambiguity corpus · §12 degradation rows (rules-blind, throwing
homebrew, empty folds, defect throw) · the §11.6 stress fixture (4 PCs + cohort 8 +
6 clocks + 8 conditions): compose() p95 ≤ 15ms asserted in CI · fold-shape
conformance vs CORE_FOLDS · runtime precompose/delta/consent flows on a live log.
Core substrate re-verified first: 141/141 green.

**Non-dictated decisions, recorded (none silent):**
1. **Fold-state types mirrored, not exported from core** — core's sealed export
   surface untouched; a conformance test pins the mirrors to `CORE_FOLDS` law.
2. **RubricColor is a token reference** (`--severity-N`), never a raw color — the
   Ledger System's token law applied to the value tree itself.
3. **RiteSet answers narrowed defensively** (core carries them opaquely; SPEC-R1
   owns shapes): malformed → 'unruled', throw → 'blocked/unruled homebrew' (§12).
4. **Statline reads rite-namespace first** (`body.ext['aa.rites.5e'].statblock`),
   plain facet honored for rules-blind worlds; absence renders null (em-dash at the
   component layer), never invented numbers.
5. **The hand derives from the being's authored `hand` ref list** (rite-namespace
   first) — hand *derivation* is rite-content jurisdiction; the mechanism is the
   graph either way.
6. **Rail HP shown for the perspective's own beings only** — the rail never leaks
   another's numbers; upstream redaction remains the law for hidden creatures.
7. **DERIVE (stage 4b) lands with `@ash-archive/rites-5e`** — placed-only by law;
   the pipeline seam is in place, folded cards carry no derived numbers.

**⚑ Seams for the canon holder (recorded, defensively handled, zero drift):**
- **S-1 · Action economy is not folded** — core's v1 combat fold carries no
  per-being economy; the pinned ActionEconomy reads structurally and defaults to
  'available'. Candidate SPEC-001 v1.3 fold amendment (`action.spent` exists in
  the vocabulary; the reducer doesn't count it).
- **S-2 · Concentration is not folded** — `concentration.started/broken` exist in
  the vocabulary; no fold tracks the concentrating rite. ConcentrationMark reads
  structurally; renders only when a future fold carries it.
- **S-3 · Cohort alive-count is graph-authored** (`body.cohort.alive`), not folded
  from damage events — M5's decrement-on-member-defeat needs fold support.
- **S-4 · PacingThread is count-based** (scenes/rulings/rolls) — wallTime is
  display-only by SPEC-001 §3.1, so "wall-clock since last decision" cannot be
  computed purely; the observation uses sessionMeta counts until the fold carries a
  display-time seam.

## BR-006 · The Foundation enters the webview + `@ash-archive/ledger-ui` + the Study (2026-07-19)

**What shipped.**
1. **The wasm vault** — `@ash-archive/core` now RUNS in the shell's webview, whole:
   `apps/studio-shell/src/vault/` provides the SPEC-001 §5.1 PlatformBinding over
   the **official SQLite WASM build** (FTS5 — the DDL requires it; sql.js was tried
   first and rejected: no FTS5), with node-module shims (pako-backed zlib for the
   Ash's snapshot gzip; WebCrypto randomBytes + js-sha256 createHash for ULIDs and
   the Binding's planHash; throwing fs stubs — export/import are host-bridge
   territory, recorded). Durability: debounced serialize → Tauri host
   (`vault_save`/`vault_load`/`vault_list`, atomic tmp+rename, base64 IPC;
   `src-tauri/src/world_vault.rs`, cargo check green) or IndexedDB in browser dev;
   flush on blur/pagehide/hidden (§4.3's checkpoint moments applied to the seam).
2. **`packages/ledger-ui`** — GENESIS 08-VII made real in React: the complete
   closed Element roster (28 renderers), FolioView (vertical runner as region
   label, roman pagination, pinned zone, margins with pencil °/ash ▵/whisper,
   ribbons, rubricated page-cast at the sealed 15%), FolioSpread (Turn in the
   Transition register; reduced-motion 200ms crossfade law; the earned wheel's
   shell half — offers as gold edge whisper, N=3 consent prompt per ADR-002-A).
   Token-only CSS, ledger-lint clean; A11yContract carried onto the DOM.
3. **The Study** — the seated React workspace mounted from the desk ("the studio"
   in the desk foot, or ⌘K anywhere): rooms (Table · Forge · Charter · Chronicle)
   over one live vault; the palette sovereign/instant/world-free (SH1 §2.6);
   room movement as the drift-cut asymptote (240ms + 12px directional drift,
   declared as the world constant it is, cited); backdrop still swap stays in the
   vanilla shell (world law never enters the React tree); route_log transits
   fire-and-forget. TableRoom wires both sealed spreads over ComposerRuntime:
   damage/heal/quill/dice/rest/reactions append their exact vocabulary events;
   auto-turn executes only composed directives; manual turns revoke scene consent.

**Verified.** ledger-lint clean (shell + ledger-ui) · strict tsc clean everywhere ·
vite build green (sqlite3.wasm bundled; Study/boot lazy chunks — the journey path
loads none of it) · ledger-ui 7/7 render-contract tests · **the wasm-vault smoke
suite 3/3 against the EXACT browser module graph** (vitest aliased identically to
vite): draft→link→session→fold→compose (40−7=33 on the HP numeral)→runtime
deltas→binding.plan→charter.lock→readiness→serialize/deserialize round-trip.
Chrome-extension driving was unavailable again this session; the founder's walk
(Wonder/Purist) remains the experiential gate, as chartered.

**Non-dictated decisions, recorded (none silent):**
1. **Official sqlite-wasm over sql.js** — FTS5 is DDL law; the official build is
   the maintained artifact. First-run defect found by the smoke suite and fixed:
   `SQLITE_DESERIALIZE_RESIZEABLE` misspelled → SQLITE_FULL; closed handles now
   bank their bytes so shelf.create → openWorld survives the in-memory engine.
2. **React mounts only for seated instruments** — the journey and the /GOAL desk
   remain the vanilla sealed working state; the Study is a destination, not a
   rewrite of the approach.
3. **First-run world** auto-created ("The First World") — creation must not gate
   on a form (GENESIS 03 §XII empty-state law); naming belongs to the Charter Room.
4. **Base64 IPC for vault bytes** — worlds are small at v1; the raw-body channel
   is the recorded upgrade path.
5. **The desk gains one quiet affordance** ("the studio") beside "the walk" —
   a door, at the footnote register; the founder's page is otherwise untouched.
6. **rules-blind Table at v1** (`riteSet: null`, §12 row 1) — the Table runs
   complete without the interpreter; `@ash-archive/rites-5e` remains SPEC-R1's
   own build lane.

**⚑ For the canon holder:** export/import (§9, the ownership covenant's file
tree) is not yet reachable from the webview — the fs shims throw loudly. The
recorded path: a Tauri host bridge (write the export tree via Rust). Until then
the covenant is honored at the bytes level (the .aa.sqlite files in app-data are
the user's, inspectable, and survive the app). Docket-adjacent, not drift.

## BR-007 · The Forge, the Charter Room, the Chronicle — the Desk and Ledger stances seated (2026-07-19)

**What shipped.** Three seated rooms over the live vault (parallel workstreams,
each verified ledger-lint clean + strict tsc clean):

1. **ForgeRoom** (SPEC-003 v1.1): the Gate strip persistent above six tabs
   (Substrate · Toybox · Web · Atlas · Bestiary · Eras), rendering
   `charter.readiness()` as craft teaching (W-3/W-4) with a one-tap smallest-next-
   build worklist; all §2 instruments (gravity truths, scarcity, faith/magic
   three-channel tells, lattice actors, chokepoints, toys, four-step clocks,
   lever-less-draftable portable truths with the Lever-Test teaching marks);
   kindle → `entry.kindled` in ≤2 gestures (§8); the Web lists links under the
   seven types with a from→type→to drafting instrument; bounded-UNKNOWN toggle on
   every form; **no lock affordance exists in the file (W-2)**; every Result
   failure surfaces as teaching, never a raw code (§9).
2. **CharterRoom** (SPEC-001 §7): readiness report (verdict, eight domains,
   missing minimums, smallest next build); the docket with the three-patch bench
   (minimal/clean/story, prefilled bodies); lock with an inline ask ("bind this to
   canon?") — E-1003's message IS the gate teaching; demote-with-note; the rulings
   shelf by layer.
3. **ChronicleRoom** (SPEC-001 §6 + GENESIS 06): the Binding ceremony —
   plan(sessionId) rendered as scenes + items (op descriptions with resolved
   names, citations, ⚑ conflicts, Lever-Test lines), three-way dispositions,
   challenged items forced to hold-as-ash, an explicit ratify step, and the seal
   as a press-and-hold gold instrument on the ceremony register (880ms) with
   keyboard parity — gravity as stillness, no spectacle; bank-the-fire as the
   quiet secondary. The shelf: bound session spines + the open session's recent
   ash (struck events struck through).

**Non-dictated decisions:** recorded in the workstream reports and carried here by
reference — notably: toy-listing predicate (activeProblem/hooks facets), ruling
discriminants (discernmentTells presence = faith contract), amber-partial state
rendered with `--gold-dim` + text (no amber token exists), era ordering client-side
on `worldTime` (EntryQuery has no body ordering), `rulings(layer)` per-layer calls
(unrecognized layers not invented into groups), lever "not yet live" as one
teaching mark (H5c), demote list unfiltered (no kind restriction in §7.1), ratify
as an explicit movement before the seal (GENESIS 06), hold-timing JS literals
mirroring the ceremony tokens.

## BR-008 · The release-candidate audit — adversarial pass + repairs + CI + the installable (2026-07-19)

**The audit.** A fresh-context adversarial reviewer was set on every surface built
this campaign (rooms, spread, runtime, vault bridge) with the core sources as
ground truth. **Ten confirmed findings; all repaired same-day:**

1. **BLOCKER — `Buffer` undefined in the webview**: core's Ash uses the bare Node
   global for snapshot gzip; the 50th append of a device would THROW mid-play.
   Node-run tests could never catch it. Fixed: the boot path installs the global
   before the Foundation loads. (The class of bug the charter's fresh-context
   verification discipline exists for.)
2. **Wrong-being attribution**: `action.spent`/`reaction.taken` charged the
   world's first-created being; with no beings, an empty id failed ULID
   validation. Fixed: the acting being is the combat fold's active turn, else the
   perspective's own being; never a guess, never an empty append.
3. **The earned wheel could be pumped**: an accepted offer's whisper lingered and
   three clicks on it reached consent from ONE real offer. Fixed: an offer is
   consumable exactly once; a manual turn breaks the consecutive-accept streak.
4. **Core defect vs SPEC-003 §2**: `charter.readiness` omitted `place` from the
   toys domain — a complete place-toy never counted toward the gate while the
   Forge showed it complete. Fixed in core WITH a regression test (28/28 charter
   suite green; a defect-repair toward sealed law, not drift).
5. **Persist races**: overlapping flushes could land older bytes after newer
   under an "inked" report; failed flushes never retried without a new write.
   Fixed: flushes chain through one in-flight promise; failure reschedules;
   closed-but-dirty files persist from banked bytes.
6. **Page-cast severity**: the rubricated cast took the last element's color,
   not the highest severity (§9.1). Fixed: max-severity wins.
7. **MoreAffordance unfolded to nothing**: §5.2's "always reachable via one
   Unfold" now opens the folded list by name. 8–10: dead statement removed,
   duplicate React keys fixed, minor hardenings.

**Recorded-not-repaired (jurisdiction):** `reviseDraft` carries no stale-head
detection (E-1102 unimplementable from the dictated signature — the core
workstream's own v1.3 candidate, reconfirmed); ForgeRoom's E-1102 teaching copy
stands ready for it. Chronicle re-seal surfaces raw E-1301 (wart). Recompose cost
is O(events²) over a session (six subscriptions × full-log folds) — correct
output, a performance debt for the §15 harness lane.

**CI (SHIP-LEDGER row 13).** `.github/workflows/studio-ci.yml`: token
byte-identity · every package's ledger-lint/tsc/tests (core 141 · tokens 60 ·
composer 37 · ledger-ui 7 · atelier 15 · shell smoke 3) · the shell's production
build · the manifest gate (dev law on branches; **SHIPPING law on v-tags — an
UNCURATED asset fails the release, closable only by intake-PASS**) · cargo check
on windows.

**The installable.** `tauri build` against the verified dist produced
**`Ash & Archive — The Studio_0.1.0_x64-setup.exe` (185MB, NSIS)** — installable,
self-contained. CSP amended with `'wasm-unsafe-eval'` (WebView2 refuses
WebAssembly compilation without it — the wasm vault is the whole point); the CSP
stays otherwise exact. Named choice: **bundle target moved MSI→NSIS** — WiX's
candle refuses to run against this working tree (the `&` in the repo path);
NSIS bundles clean. MSI may return from a CI checkout whose path carries no `&`.

**Higgsfield (HARD LAW 3, ASK-FIRST).** A ≈200-credit budget was authorized this
campaign. **Zero credits were burned — deliberately.** The shipping floor's
stills exist (15, intake-queued); every new generation would land UNCURATED
behind the same one gate only the canon holder's hand can open (rows 6/11).
Spending against a closed gate buys inventory, not product. The recorded
art-director judgment: the budget waits for (a) intake capacity, and (b) the
SH2-expressed software-surface assets (onboarding, empty-state etchings, the
maker's mark) to be art-directed as one batch, shot records first.
